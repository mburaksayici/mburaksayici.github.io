    I'm Burak, ML lover/researcher/engineer dating back to 2017, with nearly four years spent on Healthcare AI. Not claiming I'm perfect on all, but I have put a lot of effort into each of them at different eras. Mostly in CV but now switching to LLMs.

    Lately, I'm providing consultancy services for startups, and I've had several attempts at founding as well. Previously, I've leveraged <a href="https://gesund.ai" target="_blank">GesundAI</a> to CB Insights AI 100 as its first engineer and learned tons of startup skills (how to build/design a product, lead a business contract, being a 10x engineer).

    On the research side, I've built the xAI library <a href="https://github.com/mburaksayici/Why" target="_blank">Why</a>, preprinted on attention networks at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04836v1" target="_blank">Stanford BDS in 2019</a>, and worked on various ML applications in nano-scale micromilling.

This isn't my first time publishing content. I have a <a href="https://youtube.com/MakineOgrenmesi" target="_blank">YouTube channel on ML&DL</a> with 15k+ subscribers and 750k+ views, published an <a href="https://udemy.com/MakineOgrenmesi" target="_blank">Udemy course</a>, and was an ML blogger back then.

<p>Kudos to <a href="https://huyenchip.com" target="_blank">Chip Huyen</a>, I've literally been influenced a lot by her website.</p>
